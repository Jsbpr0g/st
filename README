This is my configuration of the suckless utility "st-256color"

I have added the following patches to this utility.

None. Instead I have integrate pywal to this file for color. When using st with pywal, remember to delete the /home/user/.cache/wal/colors-wal-st.h before recompiling.

This is not a finished build
